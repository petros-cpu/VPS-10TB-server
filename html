Alright! Here's a full Termux script that:

1. Installs required packages (openssh, rclone)


2. Connects to your server via SSH


3. Sets up and mounts the server storage via rclone (SFTP method)




---

One-in-all Termux script:

# Step 1: Install SSH and rclone
pkg update -y && pkg install openssh rclone -y

# Step 2: SSH into server (edit with your real credentials)
ssh root@your.server.ip.address

# Step 3: Configure rclone for SFTP (manual step)
echo "Now setting up rclone. Follow the prompts to add a new remote (choose SFTP)."
rclone config

# Step 4: Create a mountpoint folder
mkdir -p ~/mnt

# Step 5: Mount the remote server (edit 'myremote' and path if needed)
rclone mount myremote:/ ~/mnt --vfs-cache-mode writes


---

How to Use:

Replace root@your.server.ip.address with your actual server IP.

In rclone config, create a new remote, choose SFTP, and name it myremote.

The mounted 10TB storage will be available in ~/mnt.
